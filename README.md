   - Total monthly/yearly expenses summary.

3. **Filtering by Date**:
   - Let users filter expenses by month or year.
   - Display filtered totals accordingly.

4. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use a charting library (like `recharts` or `chart.js`) to visualize expenses over time.

5. **Local Storage**:
   - Save expenses in local storage so that they persist between page reloads.

#### **Advanced Features (Optional)**:
- **Income Tracking**: Add income tracking, so users can see a balance between income and expenses.

- **Authentication**: Let users sign in and sync their data with a database.

This project covers React fundamentals like state and props, component structure, and lifecycle methods. Youâ€™ll also get experience integrating external libraries and working with local storage, plus optional features like authentication and budgeting.
